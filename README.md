# During my master's statistics course, my graduation project focused on a comprehensive analysis of the US presidential election. I examined voter demographics, turnout rates, and the influence of various factors on electoral outcomes. Leveraging data-driven methodologies, I explored the impact of social media engagement, swing state dynamics, and historical voting trends. Utilizing predictive modeling, I aimed to forecast potential election results and understand the underlying complexities of voter behavior. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of statistical techniques and their application in elucidating the intricacies of major political events.
